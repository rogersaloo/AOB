TO check the version in the CMD type <code>wsl --version</code>.     - After theis steps update the wsl to update all the dependacies that might have come with the OS. Run <code>wsl --update</code>. 3. For older OS you need to set up the windows feature for WSL.      - Go to the windows button and type <code>Turn windows features on or off</code> .     - Select the <code>Windows Subsytem for Linux</code>, tick on the check box and OK.     - Restart the PC for the changes to take effect. </p> <ol> <li>After restarting the computer the following window appears when you open the ubuntu shell.<ul> <li>Enter the user name and the password when prompted by the unix shell.
